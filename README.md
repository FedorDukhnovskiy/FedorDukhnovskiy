## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a data scientist, manager, and economist with more than 5 years of experience in various industries, including venture capital, consulting, R&D, and technology. I enjoy researching, developing, and launching new products to new markets. 

## More personal
I am a big fan of efficient, organized work and life-long learning, which have helped me become a better version of myself every day. When I'm not working, you can find me at the beach, exploring California's aesthetic nature, feeding ducks, or playing basketball
